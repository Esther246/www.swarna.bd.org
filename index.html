                              <h4>Mother and Child health:</h4>Mother and Child health ( Mother and child health protection in Covid-19 situations):Sayeda Anwar, head professor of the children's department at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, said the rate of corona virus infection among children was low. Especially in the age group of 0-9 years, the infection does not go away. Although its effect on children is less, there is no chance to be careless with them. Bacteria other than corona virus should not be forgotten. If germs enter the body of these children, others in the family can also be infected through them. So it is better to avoid risk. Although the risk of corona virus infection is slightly lower in young children, children who are malnourished may have a higher risk. Afroza Qutubi, a professor in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital, said the risk of contracting the virus was high during pregnancy due to low immunity. Corona virus infections can occur along with other viruses. Mothers who are pregnant and have just given birth (especially within 2 weeks) should be especially careful. For mother and baby Experts advise adhering to the general rules of corona virus prevention. Apart from this, the overall care of mother and child will continue like any other time.
